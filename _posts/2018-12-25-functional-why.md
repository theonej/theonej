# Why functional programming (FP for the context of this post)?

This is not going to be another post about what FP is, and why it has comparitive advantages over some other styles.

If that is what you are looking for, please take a look at these references:

[Practical functional code in python](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming])
This post displays insight into not only how FP is used, but also why it is popular.  The section on `Donâ€™t iterate over 
lists. Use map and reduce.` has some great examples of how to apply functions to lists.  The progression of built in functions to custom 
<in-line>functions</in-line> as lambdas provides an intuitive example of the balance of conciseness and function that contributes to python's 
popularity.

[Lambdas in c++]([)https://medium.com/@DakshHub/lambdas-the-companion-of-modern-c-b7dfd43b5abb)
![lambdas in c++](../../../img/c++lambdas.png) For fun, google `lambdas in c++` followed by `FP inc++`.  The results are geared towards very different audiences.

This article has a good section on the basics of FP, an explanation (and samples) of how c++ approaches FP.  
The discussion on `Why use Functional Programming?` describes the mechanical and efficiency advantages of FP.  
What I am hoping to do here is to discuss the financial, temporal and human advantages that, IMO, make a more convincing
argument for the adoption of some FP practices.
