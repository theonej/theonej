	<h1>Building Serverless Microservices with Lambda</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			One of the early design decisions I made for <a href="https://contextum-ml.com" target="_blank">Contextum</a> was to have it built
			with a micro-services architecture in mind.  I wanted to have the ability to quickly expand the system to add new
			languages into the stack, or add new areas of functionality without having to redeploy/retest other parts of the system
			that are not affected by the changes I am working on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the design goals for the microservices was to have them deployed in a serverless system so that I don't have to 
			worry about scaling.  Fortunately AWS provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">Lambda</a> exactly
			for this purpose.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lambda is a great framework to work with with a for a number of reasons:
			<h2>Support for multiple languages</h2>
			<p>
				Lambda supports all of the languages we use at <a href="https://contextum-ml.com" target="_blank">Contextum</a> 
				(c#, node.js, python) plus more (php, java, go).  This is great since we don't have to build infrastructure to support
				all of our different modules and run them on separate platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will say this though:  .net core is "not quite there" yet.   It's a great idea, and both Microsoft and AWS
				are making strides to support .net in lambda, but it is by far the most difficult language to work with in Lambda (IMHO).
			</p>
			<p>
				And while Lambda is great for running python, you are definitely at the mercy of the Lambda AMI in terms of what libraries
				are available.  Trying to deploy a function that uses sklearn or nltk is a non-trivial exercise.
			</p>
			<h2>Automatic Scalability</h2>
			<p>
				Lambda does not require you to worry about scaling out your code based on demand.  AWS provides some great tools for scaling
				your code (ELB, ASG, CloudWatch metrics, SQS), but Lambda takes it to another level.  Simply upload your code.  AWS will scale
				it up and down for you, and only charge you for the actual time your code is being executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my mind this kind of change is as huge to infrastructure scaling as garbage collection was to memory management at the 
				code level, and I anticipate a similar leap in developer productivity as a result. 
			</p>
			<h2>Automatic Logging</h2>
			<p>
				This one is near and dear to my heart.  I can not explain how many times I have had to implement logging from scratch,
				and just how sick of doing that I am.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are familiar with <a href="https://12factor.net/logs" target="_blank">The Twelve-Factor App</a>, and specifically with
				the approach to logs (treat them as event streams), you will probably agree that Lambda does it right.  simply log to the 
				console (console.log in node.js, print in python, Console.WriteLine in c#) and Lambda takes care of shipping your log events
				to CloudWatch, where they are fully search-able and time ordered.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hopefully this means I will never write logging code again.
			</p>
			<h2>Fan Out</h2>
			<p>
				This one is not so much a feature of Lambda, but more of an architectural decision enabled by serverless microservices in general.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing that is always nice to have is the ability to write your persistence code once, and then have a pub/sub pattern
				where you can add additional processors at a later date without updating your code.
			</p>
			<p>
				One use case for this that I come across fairly frequently is auditing.  Almost all systems that grow to any level of 
				complexity require, at some point or another, an audit trail of who did what to which thing and and what time.
			</p>
			<p>
				While this may not be a consideration when you first start working on a system, it can easily be implemented later without 
				re-architecting your code by using message patterns.  You know what, this is beyond the scope of this article.  
				<a href="message-patterns.html">I'll write another one on this specific topic.</a>
			</p>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				Lambda is a great system for building serverless microservices, which can make your system easier to work with,
				faster to get up and running, more resilient to failure and more efficient(read:cheaper) to run.
