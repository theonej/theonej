		<h1>Graph QL + gRPC</h1>
		<p>
			I am looking at re-architecting some of my micro-services that are currently deployed as .net web API services
			to make them more responsive and easier to deploy.
		</p>
		<p>
			A good portion of these services are connecting to data stores through REST interfaces (e.g. couchdb, elasticsearch).
			Since it will greatly simplify my code base, I am rewriting some of these services as node.js services, and retiring the 
			.net services (some will live on).
		</p>
		<p>
			As I was looking at ways I could wring as much performance out of these serves as possible, I happened to have a conversation
			with an architect out in L.A. who introduced me to a new architecture I had not been previously exposed to (I am 
			both humbled and grateful for his guidance).
		</p>
		<p>
			The architecture he introduced me to is an extension of the 
			<a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/" target="_blank">micro-services with API gateway</a> 
			pattern.  This pattern is great when you want to have a system that you can easily extend (or contract) without changing the endpoints
			your clients need to interact with. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the extended architecture, the API gateway is still used, but the service interface to the API gateway is a graphql service.
			In <a href="http://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> clients can specify exactly what data they want from a service.
		</p>
		<p>
			S say, for example, you have a service that returns a structure similar to the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
				{
					type,
					number, 
					country,
					date,
					abstract,
					description,
					kind,
					link,
					filename,
					title
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			but you are only interested in displaying a list of items with columns for type, number and title.  In a standard REST service,
			you would get back all of the data and only display what you want in your list.  This works, but is highly inefficient. 
		</p>
		<p>
			With GraphQL, you could send a query that looks like:
		</p><pre>
			<code>
				{
					type,
					number,
					title
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
			and get back only those three fields.  This makes your API mush more friendly and efficient.
		</p>
		<h2>What about gRPC?</h2>
		<p>
			Now that you have an API gateway with GraphQL to manage getting data from your individual micro-services, you need a way to 
			get results from those services that is as fast as possible.  This is where <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC</a>
			comes into play.
		</p>
		<p>
			gRPC is an implementation of Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Protocol buffers are, in Google's words:
		</p>
		<em>
			Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, 
			but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated 
			source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
		</em>
		<p>
			Basically it turns data into binary and creates contracts on the client and server side for enforcing structure.  It's implemented over HTTP/2 
			and is very fast.
		</p>
		<p>
			The way gRPC can be used in our architecture is to act as the communication channel between the API gateway and the individual micro-services
			that are returning data to us.  This ensures that our service is as fast as possible when returning data to a client, while maintaining a 
			single entry point over a known protocol (http) that doesn't change when our services do.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will be using this approach in my refactor of my services, and will post more about any insights I discover along the way.
