		<h1>Elasticsearch with c#</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Over at <a href="https://contextum-ml.com" target="_blank">Contextum</a>, we use elasticsearch for a lot of our search data.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have a number of languages in our back-end stack (c#, Node.js, python), but the part of the code base
				that performs our search aggregation is built in c#, so formatting queries for elasticsearch can be a bit challenging.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you've ever used c# to query REST-ful services, you know that formatting a json object in .net is nowhere nearly
				as intuitive as it is in python or node.js.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Take for example the following query object for elasticsearch:
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
	{
		"query": { 
			"match": { 
				"account_number": 20 
			} 
		}
	}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				In node.js it would be as simple as constructing the query:
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
	var query = { 
		match: { 
			account_number: 20 
		} 
	}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				In  python, it's virtually the same:
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
	query = { 
		'match': { 
			'account_number': 20 
		} 
	}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				However, when you get into c# land, it is not quite so simple.  
				You could, of course, create a domain object that looks something like:
			</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
	class Query
	{
		public MatchInfo match{get;set;}
	}

	class MatchInfo
	{
		public int account_number{get;set;}
	}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				and then use something like Newtonsoft to serialize the object, but that is...rather heavyweight.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I have taken to doing instead is something a little more lightweight.  Using dynamics, you can construct
				an object on the fly that has the properties you need, without creating a long-lived domain object, like so:
			</p>

			<pre>
				<code>
	dynamic query = new { };
	query.match = new { };
	query.match.account_number = 120;
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
				While still a bit clunkier than constructing the object in node or python, it's still a lot better than constructing
				json objects as domain objects and then serializing them.
