			Recently I was working on a project where I needed to pull down a large set of PDFs and pull some data off of them.
			  At first, I was fairly intimidated by this task, since scraping data off of PDFs was not something I had done before,
			  nor did I really have the right tools to do this.
		</p>
		<p>
			After doing some research, I found that there is a great tool for doing exactly what I need:  Tesseract.

			<a href="https://opensource.google.com/projects/tesseract">Tesseract</a> is an open source project that has been developed 
			by Google since 2006, although it's origins date back to the 80's (click <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Here</a> for details).
		</p>
		<p>
			Long story short, I implemented a python module that calls tesseract fromt he command line to first convert the pdf to a tiff
			image, then to ocr the tiff image and output the contents into a text file.

	import os 
	import json

	def read_pdf(file_path, data_type):
		
		tiff_file = file_path.replace('.pdf', '.tiff')

		convert_command = 'convert -density 300 ' + file_path + ' -depth 8 -strip -background white -alpha off ' + tiff_file
		os.system(convert_command)

		text_file = file_path.replace('.pdf', '')
		read_command = 'tesseract ' + tiff_file + ' ' + text_file
		os.system(read_command)

		contents = '';
		with open(text_file + '.txt', "r") as f:
						for line in f:
							contents = contents + '\n' + line


		datum = {
			"file":file_path,
			"type":data_type,
			"contents":contents
		}

		return json.dumps(datum)
			</code>
