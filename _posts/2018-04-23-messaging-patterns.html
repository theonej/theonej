	<h1>Messaging Patterns with Microservices</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="https://theonej.github.io/2018/04/23/lambda.html">In my last post</a>, I talked a little bit about AWS Lambda as a platform
		for building serverless microservices, and near the end I touched on one of the great architectures it enables:
		<em>Message Fanout</em>.
	</p>
	<h2>Why Use Messaging Patterns?</h2>
	<p>
		Without going through all of the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html" target="_blank">
		benefits and drawbacks of microservices</a>, I will say that introducing messaging patterns into a system enable the break down of monolithic
		systems into microservice platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where I find it most advantageous to use messaging is when I don't know how I am going to use data later on.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, <a href="https://contextum-ml.com">let's say I am building a system </a>
		where I store some information about a search that is being performed.  Initially I probably only care about making sure the data gets
		to the database so that I can use it later.  To do this, I might call the DB interface directly, tightly coupling my persistence
		code to the time it takes for the designated implementation to complete, and ensuring a single action is taken when I 
		persist the data (the storage in a database).
	</p>
	<p>
		With a little bit of modification, we can easily enable processing of the data being persisted by multiple concurrent 
		subsystems, with no further modification of the code later on.
	</p>
	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	<p>
		Implementation of a messaging pattern that enables down-stream processing of your data is very straight-forward.  
		<ul>
			<li>
				Pick a message queue implementation (I prefer AWS SQS, <a href="https://dingyuliang.me/mq-best-10-message-queue-open-source-libraries/" target="_blank">
				but there are many others</a>) 
			</li>
			<li>
				Implement an interface to your queue that can be injected into your persistence code
			</li>
			<li>
				When data is persisted, send a message to the queue of your choice containing the data that was persisted.  A note on this:
				many queues have a max message size that must be respected.  In this case, a link back to your data (e.g. a REST endpoint)
				can be queued up to allow other processes to gain access to your full data package.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add message subscribers to your data.  Most queue systems support subscriptions to queues and work in a pub/sub
				pattern.  If you are using AWS, the pattern is inverted a bit, in that you should publish to a SNS topic and
				SNS will populate SQS queues that are subscribed to the topic.  Conceptually it is the same pattern, but I don't
				think of SNS as a traditional queue system, so it seems inverted to me.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create functions to act on your data.  A great use case for this is auditing and logging.  If you publish a message about 
				a user profile that was just update and persisted to storage, you can add a subscriber function to log that a change was made to the 
				profile and a separate subscriber function to append the search to an audit log that tracks changes to user profiles over time.  
				Six months down the road, you can add another processor that uses changes to user profiles as a trigger to alert the user
				that a change has been made, in case of security breach.  the point is that after your initial investment in publishing
				the message containing the data, additional functionality that acts on that data is drastically simplified.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>
		Messaging queues an pub/sub patterns are a great way to introduce loose coupling into your systems and enable rapid enhancement
		of your system.
